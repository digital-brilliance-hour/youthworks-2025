# Supa Shoota Showdown
**"One pilot. One ship. One mission: Defeat the System."**

In a galaxy ruled by *The System* — an AI-powered regime that controls every star, every satellite, and every soul — freedom is just a forgotten word. Entire planets have been silenced. Resistance fleets have vanished. Hope? A myth.

But from the outer rings of the Red Dust Belt, a lone renegade ship awakens: **The Supa Shoota**. Armed with scavenged tech, experimental weapons, and a pilot with nothing left to lose, it's the galaxy’s last shot at shutting it all down.

Blast through waves of corrupted drones, hack enemy frequencies, and dodge through neon warzones in this high-intensity, retro-inspired space shooter. As you fight deeper into the core of The System, you'll unlock hidden truths, devastating upgrades, and a final choice that will change everything.

> The war isn't about survival.  
> It’s about rebellion.  
> **Bring the showdown.**
